      <p>The modulation of DNA accessibility by nucleosomes is a fundamental mechanism of gene regulation in eukaryotes. The nucleosome core particle (NCP) consists of 147 bp of DNA wrapped around a symmetric octamer of histone proteins. The dynamics of DNA packaging and unpackaging from the NCP affect all DNA-based chemistries, but depend on many factors, including DNA positioning sequence, histone variants and modifications. Although the structure of the intact NCP has been studied by crystallography at atomic resolution, little is known about the structures of the partially unwrapped, transient intermediates relevant to nucleosome dynamics in processes such as transcription, DNA replication and repair. We apply a new experimental approach combining contrast variation with time-resolved small angle X-ray scattering (TR-SAXS) to determine transient structures of protein and DNA constituents of NCPs during salt-induced disassembly. We measure the structures of unwrapping DNA and monitor protein dissociation from Xenopus laevis histones reconstituted with two model NCP positioning constructs: the Widom 601 sequence and the sea urchin 5S ribosomal gene. Both constructs reveal asymmetric release of DNA from disrupted histone cores, but display different patterns of protein dissociation. These kinetic intermediates may be biologically important substrates for gene regulation. </p>

      <p>Nucleic acids are highly charged polyelectrolytes that interact strongly with salt ions. Rigid, base-paired regions are successfully described with wormlike chain models, but nonbase-paired single stranded regions have fundamentally different polymer properties because of their greater flexibility. Recently, attention has turned to single stranded nucleic acids due to the growing recognition of their biological importance, as well as the availability of sophisticated experimental techniques sensitive to the conformation of individual molecules. We investigate polyelectrolyte properties of poly(dT), an important and widely studied model system for flexible single stranded nucleic acids, in physiologically important mixed mono- and divalent salt. We report measurements of the form factor and interparticle interactions using SAXS, end-to-end distances using smFRET, and number of excess ions using ASAXS. We present a coarse-grained model that accounts for flexibility, excluded volume, and electrostatic interactions in these systems. Predictions of the model are validated against experiment. We also discuss the state of all-atom, explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of poly(dT), the next step in understanding the complexities of ion interactions with these highly charged and flexible polymers. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      <p>ollowing the addition of ions to trigger folding, RNA molecules undergo a transition from rigid, extended states to a compact ensemble. Determining the time scale for this collapse provides important insights into electrostatic contributions to RNA folding; however, it can be challenging to isolate the effects of purely nonspecific collapse, e.g., relaxation due to backbone charge compensation, from the concurrent formation of some tertiary contacts. To solve this problem, we decoupled nonspecific collapse from tertiary folding using a single-point mutation to eliminate tertiary contacts in the small RNA subdomain known as tP5abc. Microfluidic mixing with microsecond time resolution and Förster resonance energy transfer detection provides insight into the ionic strength-dependent transition from extended to compact ensembles. Differences in reaction rates are detected when folding is initiated by monovalent or divalent ions, consistent with equilibrium measurements illustrating the enhanced screening of divalent ions relative to monovalent ions at the same ionic strength. Ion-driven collapse is fast, and a comparison of the collapse time of the wild-type and mutant tP5abc suggests that site binding of Mg2+ occurs on submillisecond time scales.<p/>

      <p>Dynamic RNA molecules carry out essential processes in the cell including translation and splicing. Base-pair interactions stabilize RNA into relatively rigid structures, while flexible non-base-paired regions allow RNA to undergo conformational changes required for function. To advance our understanding of RNA folding and dynamics it is critical to know the flexibility of these un-base-paired regions and how it depends on counterions. Yet, information about nucleic acid polymer properties is mainly derived from studies of ssDNA. Here we measure the persistence lengths (lp) of ssRNA. We observe valence and ionic strength-dependent differences in lp in a direct comparison between 40-mers of deoxythymidylate (dT40) and uridylate (rU40) measured using the powerful combination of SAXS and smFRET. We also show that nucleic acid flexibility is influenced by local environment (an adjoining double helix). Our results illustrate the complex interplay between conformation and ion environment that modulates nucleic acid function in vivo. </p>
